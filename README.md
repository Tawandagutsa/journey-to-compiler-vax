An interpreter is a type of program that reads and executes code line by line, rather than compiling the whole program into machine code first. It translates high-level code (like Python or JavaScript) into actions the computer can perform, making it easier to test and run code interactively.

Main Steps of an Interpreter
1. Scanning / Lexical Analysis – Converts raw code into tokens (e.g., keywords, variables, symbols).

2. Parsing (Syntax Analysis) – Arranges tokens into a structured format (AST).

3. Semantic Analysis – Ensures the code makes logical sense (e.g., type checks, variable scope).

4. Interpretation / Execution – Executes the code directly from the AST or line by line.

5. Runtime Services – Manages things like memory, input/output, and error handling during execution.
